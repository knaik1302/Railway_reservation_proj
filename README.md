This project is about online booking of tickets of train and can check the ticket details.
In SignUp page, you can create your account.
In signIn page, you can log into your account.
You can check the available trains. You can book a new ticket and also can check the details of your ticket.
If you want to book a ticket then you have to give a your username the one you have used to login.

I have used XAMPP sever to access database and to use php.
You have to create a database using XAMPP. I have attatched screenshot of created database and its ER realation.

But there are a lot of repeated codes.
If you have a two or more account and used to book a ticket using one of your account, then you can see booked ticket from other account. That's not Good!! It doesn't have a user session time.
